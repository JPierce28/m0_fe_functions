# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
  - My time management with this particular lesson was very improved from previous lessons. If I got stuck on a practice example I would just move on and try some other ones. Doing those helped me think of the problem I was stuck on before or add new information to help me solve the previous problem.
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
  - A function is a grouping of code lines that can provide instructions for you to follow.
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
  - An argument is similar to an array in that it contains different values that you can call on to print what you need. Parameters are used to call and assign the arguments you wish to print.
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
  - I will ask similar questions to these. I will ask their understanding of the new vocabulary and what a function could be used for.
